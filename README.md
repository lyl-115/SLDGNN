1. model and model2 are all the methods used in the experiments on model depth.  
2. ModelDepath.py provides the different architectures and training codes for these methods.  
3. call.py calls ModelDepath.py from the outer layer.  
4. The experiment code for methods other than HEXGNN on the 9 datasets is implemented in experiment_9datasets.ipynb.  
5. HEXGNN.ipynb contains the experimental code for the HEXGNN method on the 9 datasets.  
6. The datasets folder contains the original files of all 9 datasets mentioned in our article.
